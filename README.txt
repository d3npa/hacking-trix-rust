I wanted to have a repo of (basic) techniques in Rust.

Preferably these would be standalone `.rs` files one can refer to when
developing exploits on the fly, like during a CTF. I want to keep the code
very slim and straight-to-the-point. If possible they shouldn't depend on
crates - let's see what we can do on our own :)

I would love it if others could contribute some techniques!

P.S. I know Golang is a great language but this repo is for people who want
to write in Rust <3
