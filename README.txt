This is a repo of small programs, proof of concepts, or templates written in Rust that relate in some way to hacking and/or CTF.

I think Rust is really cool and I wanted to see what I could do with it. This repo is about sharing knowledge and experience gained from practice. All the code here is provided free and without warranty - I am not responsible to how you use or modify the code in this repo or apply the knowledge gained. Don't do something stupid.
