+----------------------------------------------------------------------------+

I think Rust is a really cool language and it has been a useful tool for me 
to learn about how computers work. Here are some programs, snippets, and 
writeups about some of the things I have learned. 

Freedom of information, expression, and association are really important 
values to me. I try to share information without bias that can be useful to
different kinds of people. 

Know your laws and don't be stupid.
