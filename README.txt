i think rust is a really cool language and it has been a useful tool for me 
to learn more about how computers work. here are some programs, snippets, and 
writeups about some of the things I have looked at.

freedom of knowledge, expression, and association are really important to me.
i try to share knowledge without bias that can be useful to different kinds of 
people. 

how you apply knowledge is your own responsibility.
know your laws and don't do something stupid.
